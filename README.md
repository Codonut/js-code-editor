# js-manualtexteditor

## Status: Functional but imperfect

A text editor that does not rely on `contenteditable` and instead handles the logic of showing a cursor, inserting and deleting text manually. Less complicated than you would expect, but does not handle locales that require multiple key presses well (e.g. Korean, Mandarin).
